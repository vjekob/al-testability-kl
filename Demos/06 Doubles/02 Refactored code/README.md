# Demo 2: Decouped code

In this example we have decoupled our original code. ConvertCurrency01.Codeunit.al contains the old
code for reference, while ConvertCurrency02.Codeunit.al contains the new, refactored code.

The changes we did have both made our code better structured, but also more testable. In demos that
follow, we will see how we can start testing our functionality in a better way.
